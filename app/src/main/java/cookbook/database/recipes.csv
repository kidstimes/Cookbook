Chicken Caesar Salad;A classic chicken salad recipe, featuring crunchy croutons and a creamy, garlic dressing. Ideal for lunch with friends.;"Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Tear the ciabatta into big, ragged croutons or, if you prefer, cut with a bread knife. Spread over a large baking sheet or tray and sprinkle over 2/3rds of the olive oil.\nRub the oil into the bread and season with a little salt if you like (sea salt crystals are best for this). Bake for 8-10 mins, turning the croutons a few times during cooking so they brown evenly.\nRub the skinless, boneless chicken breasts with the rest of the olive oil, season. Place pan over a medium heat for 1 min, until hot, but not smoking. Lay the chicken on the pan (it will sizzle if it’s hot enough) and leave for 4 mins.\nTurn the chicken, then cook for 4 mins more. Check if it’s cooked by poking the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part; there should be no sign of pink and juices will run clear.\nBash the garlic cloves with the flat of a knife and peel off the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher. Mash the anchovies with a fork against the side of a small bowl.\nGrate a handful of parmesan cheese and mix with the garlic, anchovies, mayonnaise and white wine vinegar. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt – if yours is thicker, stir in a few tsps water to thin it.\nShave the cheese with a peeler. Tear the romaine lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl. Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons.\nAdd most of the dressing and toss with your fingers. Scatter the rest of the chicken and croutons, then drizzle with the remaining dressing. Sprinkle the parmesan on top and serve straight away."

Chipotle Grilled Tofu;Tofu gets quick-marinated in an herby, citrus marinade reminiscent of Mojo sauce but with smoky notes, then grilled to perfection. The tofu doesn't stick and it turns out perfectly chewy and crispy!;Drain the tofu. Slice the tofu crosswise into ⅓-inch slabs, about 8 to 11 slices per block. Arrange on a paper towel-lined cutting board and add a few paper towels on top. Weight with a heavy cookbook or cast-iron skillet. Press for 15 minutes to remove excess water.\nMake the marinade: To a blender or food processor, add the cilantro, chipotle peppers and adobo sauce, garlic, orange zest, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, sugar, cumin, salt, and black pepper to taste. Blend until relatively smooth. Season to taste with more salt and pepper needed. Reserve 4 tablespoons of the marinade.\nTransfer tofu slabs to a shallow dish or pan and pour the rest of the marinade on top, using a pastry brush to evenly coat the tofu. Allow to marinate for at least 15 minutes at room temperature, or up to 1 hour in the fridge.\nPrepare the grill. Preheat a gas grill (between medium and medium-high) with the lid on for at least 10 minutes to get the grates really hot. Scrub down with a heavy-duty grill brush to remove any gunk or drippings.\nSet a small bowl with a few tablespoons of oil near the grill and oil up a wad of paper towels in the oil. Use a set of tongs to rub the preheated grill grates with the oil-soaked towels. Let the oil smoke for 40 seconds or so, then rub with oil again. Repeat three to four times total to build up a good layer of seasoning.\nImmediately before or as soon as you add the tofu, turn the burners directly under the tofu to low heat and close the lid. Grill the tofu for 8 to 10 minutes, until nice grill marks form. Using a pair of tongs and/or a thin metal spatula, carefully flip each tofu slab and grill for another 7 to 10 minutes.\nOnce the tofu is grilled, brush it with the reserved marinade.
